## Assumptions & Projections Documentation

### Growth Rate Assumptions

1. **Digital Economy CAGR**: 25-30% assumed based on historical Karnataka IT sector growth (2018-2025) and India's digital economy trajectory
   - Source: NASSCOM Industry Reports, STPI Karnataka Data
   - Validation: Aligns with India's digital economy growth from $400B → $1T → $3T by 2030 trajectory

2. **GCC Growth Rate**: Acceleration from ~40 GCCs/year (2024-25) to ~100 GCCs/year needed for 500 new GCCs by 2029
   - Source: KDEM GCC Policy 2024 targets vs. current growth rate (NASSCOM, Zinnov)
   - Risk Factor: Requires significant acceleration amid Telangana competition

### Attribution Methodology

3. **Beyond Bengaluru Company Attribution**
   - Methodology: Companies counted when KDEM has:
     - Issued formal facilitation letter
     - Documented connection through BTS/Technovanza/cluster events
     - Provided through ELEVATE/LEAP/program participation
   - Validation: Cross-checked with company announcements, STPI registrations
   - Conservative Approach: When attribution unclear, not counted

4. **Job Creation Metrics**
   - Primary Source: Company self-reporting to KDEM
   - Validation: EPFO/ESI data where available (quarterly lag)
   - Projection Method: For targets, based on industry averages per company type/size

### Cluster Vision Target Methodology

5. **Mysuru $10B by 2030**
   - Source: Official KDEM Vision Document 2025 - Mysuru Chapter
   - Baseline: ₹5,000 crore (~$600M) current IT exports
   - Implied CAGR: ~55% (2025-2030)
   - Assumptions: Major infrastructure completion (Global Tech Centre, PCB Park), cybersecurity cluster success

6. **Mangaluru ₹40,000 Cr by 2034**
   - Source: Draft Mangaluru Cluster Vision Document 2025
   - Baseline: ₹4,500 crore current revenue
   - Implied CAGR: ~25% (2025-2034)

## Data Update & Verification Protocol

### Update Frequencies

| Data Type | Update Frequency | Next Update | Primary Source |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| IT Export Statistics | Quarterly | April 2026 | STPI Karnataka |
| GCC Counts | Quarterly | April 2026 | NASSCOM, Zinnov |
| Startup Data | Monthly | February 2026 | DPIIT, Tracxn |
| Beyond Bengaluru Metrics | Monthly | February 2026 | KDEM Internal |
| Program Data (ELEVATE/LEAP) | Quarterly | April 2026 | KDEM Internal |
| Cluster Vision Progress | Quarterly | April 2026 | Cluster Teams |
| Competitive Intelligence | Quarterly | April 2026 | Multiple sources |

### Verification Process

1. **Cross-Source Validation**: Key metrics verified through 2+ independent sources
2. **Official Confirmation**: Government data used as primary source when available
3. **Temporal Consistency**: Historical trends checked for anomalies
4. **Stakeholder Review**: Major metrics reviewed with relevant KDEM vertical heads
5. **External Audit**: Annual independent evaluation recommended

## Limitations & Disclaimers

### Data Limitations

1. **Real-Time Data**: Some metrics have quarterly lag (e.g., EPFO employment data)
2. **Attribution Complexity**: Ecosystem outcomes (Level C) influenced by multiple factors beyond KDEM
3. **Self-Reported Data**: Company-provided information not always independently verified
4. **Projection Uncertainty**: Future targets subject to market conditions, policy changes, competitive dynamics
5. **Cluster Early Stage**: Shivamogga lacks sufficient data; Kalaburagi in early development phase

### Methodological Disclaimers

1. **Attribution Model**: Three-tier framework aims for transparency but inherently involves judgment
2. **Competitive Data**: Competitor state metrics from public sources; some may be promotional
3. **Currency Fluctuations**: Dollar amounts converted at approximate exchange rates; not inflation-adjusted
4. **Policy Changes**: Targets and incentives subject to government budget allocations and policy revisions
