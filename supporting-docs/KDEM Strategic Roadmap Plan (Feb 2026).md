# KDEM Strategic Roadmap 2025-2032
## Navigating AI Disruption to a $329 Billion Digital Economy

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** February 2026
**Prepared for:** Karnataka Digital Economy Mission (KDEM)

---

## Executive Summary

Karnataka's digital economy stands at $159 billion (FY 2024-25), driven primarily by IT Exports ($85B), ESDM ($37B), Newly Digitizing Sectors ($20B), and IT Domestic ($17B). The revised target of $329 billion by FY 2031-32 requires navigating unprecedented AI-driven workforce disruption while simultaneously capturing national opportunities and diversifying the ecosystem.

This roadmap outlines a four-phase strategy — Foundation, Navigate, Accelerate, Achieve — that moves beyond simple growth projections to address the critical uncertainties of AI displacement, competing state policies, semiconductor positioning, and ecosystem diversification.

**Key numbers:**
- Current digital economy: $159B (FY24-25)
- Target: $329B by FY31-32 (revised from original $400B)
- IT workforce: 1.5M in Karnataka, 450-600K in AI-vulnerable roles
- AI specialists needed: 300K+ (currently ~100K)
- Employment scenarios: 3.3M to 6.6M depending on AI productivity impact

## 2. AI Workforce Impact Assessment

### 2.1 Scale of Vulnerability

Karnataka's IT workforce of approximately 1.5 million faces significant AI-driven transformation. An estimated 450,000-600,000 workers are in roles highly vulnerable to AI automation within the next 3-5 years.

| Role Category | Est. Workers | Risk Level | Timeline | AI Replacement |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Manual Testing & QA | 120-150K | Critical | 2025-2027 | AI test generation, autonomous testing agents |
| L1/L2 IT Support | 80-100K | Critical | 2025-2027 | AI chatbots, self-healing systems |
| Basic Coding & Maintenance | 100-130K | High | 2026-2028 | AI code generation (Copilot, Cursor) |
| Data Entry & Processing | 60-80K | Critical | 2025-2026 | Document AI, intelligent OCR |
| BPO Voice/Chat Support | 50-70K | High | 2026-2028 | Conversational AI, multimodal agents |
| Junior Financial Analysis | 30-40K | Medium | 2027-2029 | AI-powered analytics |
| Content Writing & Translation | 20-30K | High | 2025-2027 | LLMs, automated localization |

### 2.2 Displacement Timeline

| Phase | Event | Net Effect |
|---|---|---|
| FY 2024-25 | Early AI adoption (40% of IT companies) | Hiring slowdown (-10-15% vs trend) |
| FY 2025-26 | Data entry, basic testing roles reduced | First net job losses (-50K to -80K) |
| FY 2026-27 | AI coding assistants mature, BPO automation | Peak displacement wave (-100K to -150K) |
| FY 2027-28 | Cumulative 200-300K roles automated | New AI-native roles begin offsetting |
| Post-2028 | AI-augmented workforce model established | Net positive if diversification succeeds |

### 2.3 Employment Scenarios at $329B Revenue

The critical uncertainty is revenue-per-employee, which determines total employment:

| Scenario | Rev/Employee | Employment at $329B | Likelihood |
|---|---|---|---|
| Low AI Impact | $50K | 6.58M | Unlikely (current trajectory) |
| Medium AI Impact | $75K | 4.39M | Most likely |
| High AI Impact | $100K | 3.29M | Possible with aggressive AI adoption |

**Implication:** The original "5 million jobs" target may need revision. At the most likely scenario ($75K/employee), employment reaches 4.4M — still substantial growth from today's 3.4M but below the 5M headline target.
